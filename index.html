    <h1>The Majestic Hippo</h1>

    <h2>General Background Information</h2>
    <p> 
        The hippopotamus also called the hippo, common hippopotamus, 
        or river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal and ungulate which 
        is mostly herbivorous and native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is <strong> of only 
        two extant species</strong> in the family <i class="taxonomy">Hippopotamidae</i>, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus, 
        <i class="taxonomy">(Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis)</i>. Its name comes from the ancient Greek 
        for "river horse" <strong class="greek_name">(ἱπποπόταμος)</strong>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After the elephant and rhinoceros, the hippopotamus is the <em>third-largest land mammal and is the heaviest extant land artiodactyl</em>. 
        Despite their physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial even-toed ungulates, the closest living relatives 
        of the Hippopotamidae are cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises, etc.), from which they diverged about 55 million years ago. 
        Hippos are recognisable for their barrel-shaped torsos, wide-opening mouths with large canine tusks, nearly hairless bodies, pillar-like legs, 
        and large size: adults average 1,500 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (3,310 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>) for bulls and 1,300 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (2,870 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>) for cows. 
        Despite its stocky shape and short legs, it is capable of running 30 <abbr title="kilometers per hour">km/h</abbr> (19 <abbr title="miles per hour">mph</abbr>) over short distances.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hippos inhabit rivers, lakes, and mangrove swamps. 
        Territorial bulls each preside over a stretch of water and a group of five to thirty cows and calves. 
        Reproduction and birth both occur in the water. During the day, hippos remain cool by staying in water or mud, emerging at dusk to graze on grasses. 
        While hippos rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos typically do not display territorial behaviour on land. 
        <em>Hippos are among the most dangerous animals in the world due to their highly aggressive and unpredictable nature.</em>
        They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory (canine teeth).
    </p>

    <h2>Characteristics and Adaptations</h2>

    <p>
        The hippopotamus is a megaherbivore and is exceeded in size among land animals only by elephants and some rhinoceros species. 
        The mean adult weight is around 1,480 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (3,260 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>) for bulls and 1,365 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (3,010 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>) for cows. 
        Exceptionally large males have been recorded reaching 2,660 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (5,860 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>). 
        Male hippos appear to continue growing throughout their lives, while females reach maximum weight at around age 25.
        The species has a typical head-body length of 3.3–3.45 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (10.8–11.3 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) and an average standing height of 1.4 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (4.6 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) at the shoulder.
