        The hippopotamus also called the hippo, common hippopotamus, 
        or river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal and ungulate which 
        is mostly herbivorous and native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is one of only 
        two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus 
        (Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis). Its name comes from the ancient Greek for "river horse".
