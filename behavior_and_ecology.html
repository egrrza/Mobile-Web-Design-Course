        <p>
            Hippos differ from all other large land mammals as they are semiaquatic, spending their days in lakes and rivers.They require habitat with enough water to submerge themselves in and which has plenty of grass nearby. When bodies of water feature firm, smooth, sloping beaches, larger numbers of hippos may congregate. Male hippos may also be found in very small numbers in rapid waters in rocky gorges. Hippos mostly live in freshwater habitats; however, populations in West Africa mostly inhabit estuarine waters and may even be found out at sea.

            Hippos spend most the day in water to stay cool and hydrated. Just before night begins, they leave the water to feed on land.[30] Like most herbivores, hippos will consume a variety of plants if presented with them in captivity, but their diet in nature consists almost entirely of grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants. A hippo will eat around 40 <abbr aria-label="kilograms">kg</abbr> (88 <abbr aria-label="pounds">lb</abbr>) of grass in a night while traveling 3–5 <abbr aria-label="kilometers">km</abbr> (1.9–3.1 <abbr aria-label="miles">mi</abbr>). They typically return to the water before dawn. On occasion, hippos have been filmed eating carrion, usually near the water. There are other reports of meat-eating and even cannibalism and predation. <em>The stomach anatomy of a hippo is not suited to carnivory, and meat-eating is likely caused by aberrant behaviour or nutritional stress.</em>

            Because of their size and their habit of taking the same paths to feed, hippos can have a significant impact on the land across which they walk, by keeping the land clear of vegetation and depressing the ground. Over prolonged periods, hippos can divert the paths of swamps and channels. By defecating in the water, the animals also appear to pass on microbes from their gut, affecting the biogeochemical cycle.

        <h2>Social Interaction</h2>
            <p>
                It is challenging to study the interaction of bulls and cows because hippos are not sexually dimorphic, so cows and young bulls are almost indistinguishable in the field.[71] Although hippos lie close to one another, they are generally not social animals, and they do not seem to form social bonds except between mothers and daughters. The reason they huddle close together is unknown.[8]: 49  Hippos exhibit territorial behaviour only in water, where the dominant bull – also known as a "beachmaster" – presides over a small stretch of river, on average 250 m (270 yd) in length. The beachmaster's territory typically contains a pod of 10 cows, but pods can contain over 100 hippos.[8]: 50  Younger bachelors are allowed in a beachmaster's stretch, as long as they behave submissively toward him. Hippo territories are used to establish mating rights. Within the pods, the hippos tend to segregate by sex. Bachelors lounge near other bachelors, females with other females, and the beachmaster is on his own. When hippos emerge from the water to graze, they do so individually.

                Hippos engage in "muck-spreading" which involves defecating while spinning their tails to distribute the faeces over a greater area. Muck-spreading occurs both on land and in water and its function is not well understood. It is likely not territorial as the animals only establish territories in the water."Yawning" serves as a threat display. When fighting, bulls use their incisors to block each other's attacks and their large canines to inflict injuries. When hippos become over-populated or a habitat shrinks, bulls sometimes attempt infanticide, but this behaviour is not common under normal conditions. Incidents of hippo cannibalism have been documented, but this is believed to be the behaviour of distressed or sick hippos.

                The most common hippo vocalisation is the "wheeze honk", which can be heard over long distances.[73] This call starts as a high-pitched squeal followed by a deeper, resonant call. While the purpose of these vocalisations is currently unknown, they appear to be used for social cohesion, and the animals can recognise the calls of other individuals. Hippos are more likely to react aggressively to the wheeze honks of strangers than those of animals they are more familiar with.[73] They may be able to utilise wheeze honks for echolocation. Hippos have the unique ability to hold their heads partially above the water and send out a cry that travels through both water and air; individuals respond both above and below water. They will also express threat and alarm with exhalations.[30] Fighting bulls produce loud bellows.

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
            <p>
                Cows reach sexual maturity at five to six years of age and have a gestation period of eight months. A study of endocrine systems revealed cows may begin puberty at as early as three or four years. Males reach maturity at around 7.5 years. A study of hippo reproductive behaviour in Uganda showed that peak conceptions occurred during the end of the wet season in the summer, and peak births occurred toward the beginning of the wet season in late winter. This is because of the female's oestrous cycle; as with most large mammals, male hippo spermatozoa is active year-round. Studies of hippos in Zambia and South Africa also showed evidence of births occurring at the start of the wet season. After becoming pregnant, a female hippo will typically not begin ovulation again for 17 months.

                Mating occurs in the water, with the cow submerged for most of the encounter, her head emerging periodically to draw breath. Cows isolate themselves to give birth and return to the pod within 10 to 14 days. Calves are born underwater weighing between 25 and 50 kg (55 and 110 lb) and at an average length of around 127 cm (4.17 ft). They must swim to the surface to take their first breaths. A mother typically gives birth to only one calf, though sometimes they give birth to twins. The young often rest on their mothers' backs when the water is too deep for them, and they swim under water to suckle. They will suckle on land as well when the mother leaves the water.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mother hippos are very protective of their young and may keep others at a distance. One cow was recorded protecting a calf's carcass after it had died. Calves are occasionally left in nurseries which are guarded by one or a few adults. Calves in nurseries often engage in playfights. Weaning starts between six and eight months after birth, and most calves are fully weaned after a year.Like many other large mammals, hippos are described as K-strategists, in this case typically producing just one large, well-developed infant every couple of years (rather than many small, poorly developed young several times per year, as is common among small mammals such as rodents).

        <h2>Interspecies Interactions</h2>
            <p>
                Hippos coexist alongside a variety of large predators in their habitats. Nile crocodiles, lions, and spotted hyenas are known to prey on young hippos.[33]: 273 [8]: 118  Beyond these, adult hippos are not usually preyed upon by other animals due to their aggression and size. Cases where large lion prides have successfully preyed on adult hippos have been reported, but it is generally rare.[78] Lions occasionally prey on adults at Gorongosa National Park and calves are sometimes taken at Virunga.[79] Crocodiles are frequent targets of hippo aggression, probably because they often inhabit the same riparian habitats; crocodiles may be either aggressively displaced or killed by hippos.[80] In turn, very large Nile crocodiles have been observed preying occasionally on calves, "half-grown" hippos, and possibly also adult female hippos. Groups of crocodiles have also been observed finishing off still-living male hippos that were previously injured in mating battles with other males.[81][82]

                Hippos occasionally visit cleaning stations in order to be cleaned of parasites by certain species of fishes. They signal their readiness for this service by opening their mouths wide. This is an example of mutualism, in which the hippo benefits from the cleaning while the fish receive food.[83] Hippo defecation creates allochthonous deposits of organic matter along the river beds. These deposits have an unclear ecological function.[67] A 2015 study concluded hippo dung provides nutrients from terrestrial material for fish and aquatic invertebrates,[84] while a 2018 study found that their dung can be toxic to aquatic life in large quantities, due to absorption of dissolved oxygen in water bodies.
